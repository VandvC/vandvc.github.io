## 🔧 Technical Skills

**coding** (well it seems obvious) in python, bash, SQL and typescript.<br>
**rag & agentic system** with strong focus on langchain/graph/fuse libraries.
**conventionnal nlp** like before the invasion of the external editors apis providing llms too big to be self hosted. Yep, pepperidge farms remembers good old days when having 100M parameters for your model was huge.<br>
**code versionning** (I won't pretend that I know other VCS than git, but hey, i know the difference between merge & rebase).<br>
**ro** with pyomo python library.<br>
**cloud provider** skills mostly on azure & databricks.

### ✨ Data Science & Software Engineering projects

**[how to fine tune a mistral model on colab](https://github.com/VandvC/finetune_llama7b){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
- cool project where I managed to fine tune an open source mistral base model with 7b parameters , on google colab free tier.
- using quantization techniques and lora (during the hype peak) to fit all that memory on the 15gb colab GPU.
  
**[how to logging like a pro in python](https://google.com){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**
- wip but the idea is to get the best out of logging in python
