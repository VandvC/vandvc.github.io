## Portfolio

born during the early 90's, I had to be 33 to do my first porfolio. 
better late than never.
This portfolio is guaranteed to be generated without any llm.

### 🔧 Skills

- coding (well it seems obvious) in python, bash, typescript.
- rag & agentic systems, with strong focus on langchain/graph/fuse libraries.
- conventionnal nlp, like before the invasion of the external editors apis providing llms too big to be self hosted. Yep, pepperidge farms remembers good old days when having 100M parameters for your model was huge.
- code versionning (I won't pretend that I know other VCS than git, but hey, i know the difference between merge & rebase).
- ro with pyomo python library.
